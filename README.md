# RecipeApp
Using Visual Studio Community, create a .Net console App and insert the code. Ensure that the console App uses C# as this console App was created using C#.
This should run properly as now errors were present.

# Improvements to part 1
1. The first thing which I added to part 2 that was suppossed to be in part 1 is the ability to scale your units.
This feature is added as option no.4 of my appilation called "Scale a recipe".
2. The new code has no limitation on the number of recipe entries you can create and store.
3. The program is easy to run and has clear instructions on how to do so.

# What I did in Part 2 
On top of all of the features that I added from part 1 and improved upon, these are the new features that I added to the new part 2 code:
1. You have the option to view the exact recipe you want to see instead of viewing all at once and then trying to find the exact one you are looking for.
2. The new code allow for the user to clasify what food group their ingredient item is part of to clarify for users.
3. You can better define what quantity you will be using for each indredient item.
4. There is now a limitation on the amount of calories you may add to, please note that the max amopunt of calories permitted is 300.
