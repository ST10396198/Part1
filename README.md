# RecipeApp
Using Visual Studio Community, create a .Net console App and insert the code. Ensure that the console App uses C# as this console App was created using C#.
This should run properly as now errors were present.

# Improvements to part 1
1. The first thing which I added to part 2 that was suppossed to be in part 1 is the ability to scale your units.
This feature is added as option no.4 of my appilation called "Scale a recipe".
2. The new code has no limitation on the number of recipe entries you can create and store.
3. The program is easy to run and has clear instructions on how to do so.

# What I did in Part 2 
On top of all of the features that I added from part 1 and improved upon, these are the new features that I added to the new part 2 code:
1. You have the option to view the exact recipe you want to see instead of viewing all at once and then trying to find the exact one you are looking for.
2. The new code allow for the user to clasify what food group their ingredient item is part of to clarify for users.
3. You can better define what quantity you will be using for each indredient item.
4. There is now a limitation on the amount of calories you may add to, please note that the max amopunt of calories permitted is 300.

# Running the application
Let me take you step by step through how you can use the application, the application offers a number of different features and we will
explore them all.

# After running
After running the program you will be greeted by our Menu where you will have to choose which option you would like to continue with.

# 1. Enter new recipe
After choosing option 1 you will be granted the ability to enter a new recipe.
To start you need to give your recipe a name, then you will have to prove the amount of ingredients you will use as well as the amount of steps there are.
You will then name each ingrient individually while provide the amount according to the grams unit, provide the calories count(remember to stay below 300),
and specifying the food group it belongs to, eg. protein.

# 2. View recipes
After choosing option 2 you will be taken to the recipe storage where you can choose which recipe you would like to view.
To do this you will have to enter the full name of the recipe you would like to view. Note that this is case sensitive and you are expected to
inlcude all uppercase letters and spaces as they are displayed on your given options. Once doing so the recipe will display with all the ingredients and steps
amd you will be taken back to menu.

# 3. Clear all recipes
After choosing option 3 you are granted the ability to clear all the recipes that were added to the application. Once you have done so you will be taken back to 
the menu and no recipe will be present in the application.

# 4. Scale a recipe
After choosing option 4 you will have to insert the name of the recipe you wish to scale. Once you have done so you will be able to state to what scale you
are either increasing or decreasing to. There after you can view your recipe again and the scale of the quantity will either be increased or decreased accordingly.

# 5. Exit
Upon enter 5 you will close the application and stop running it.

That wraps up the introduction on how to use the application.
I hope you enjoy using the application as much as I enjoyed making it! :-)
